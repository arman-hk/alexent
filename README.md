# AlexNet Implementation in PyTorch

This repository contains an implementation of the AlexNet convolutional neural network architecture, as described in the 2012 paper "[ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks)" by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton.
